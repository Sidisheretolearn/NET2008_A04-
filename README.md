The application is a chess game,

uppercase letters are black 
lowercase letters are white

you must enter a row of chess postions and the application will tell you who won and how many points you got based on that.

Each row must have 8 dashes in order to have the string valid

input 1 -> -------- (8 dashes)
input 2 -> ---K----
input 3 -> Q-------
input 4 -> k-------
input 5 -> --B--n--
and so on (until row 8)

at the end it will show you how many points each side will have. Tell you the winner and ask if you want to play again or quit
